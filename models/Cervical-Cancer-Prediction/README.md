# Cervical Cancer Prediction

## Problem Description

The goal is to predict the likelihood of cervical cancer in individuals based on various risk factors such as age, number of sexual partners, pregnancies, and other related attributes. Early prediction of cervical cancer can help in timely medical intervention, improving patient outcomes. This solution assists healthcare providers in diagnosing and assessing cervical cancer risk, enabling preventive measures.

## Model Description

Several classification models are employed to predict the risk of cervical cancer:

1. **Logistic Regression**: 
   - A linear model used for binary classification, ideal for determining the probability of a patient having cervical cancer based on input features.

2. **Decision Tree Classifier**: 
   - A non-parametric model that splits the dataset into branches to make decisions, useful for capturing non-linear patterns in the data.

3. **Random Forest Classifier**: 
   - An ensemble learning method that uses multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

4. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: 
   - A robust classifier that separates data points using hyperplanes, ideal for high-dimensional datasets.

5. **AdaBoost Classifier**: 
   - An ensemble learning method that improves weak learners by focusing on misclassified data points in each iteration.

These models are appropriate for this problem because they are well-suited for binary classification tasks like cervical cancer prediction. Each model offers different strengths, such as interpretability for logistic regression and the ability to model complex relationships with Random Forest.

## Expected Outcome

- A comparative analysis of multiple classification models.
- Accuracy and evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix) for each model.
- Visualization of model performance to help identify the best-suited classifier for predicting cervical cancer.

## Additional Context

- The dataset contains missing values and '?' placeholders, which have been handled during preprocessing.
- Data visualization includes histograms and correlation heatmaps for numerical and categorical variables to explore data distribution and relationships.
